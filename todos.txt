ToDos

- Motivation section: run on whole of Wos to show long term trends in DOI coverage (Anne) (DONE)
- Data selection: purely data acquisition and cleaning (DONE), move publication year analysis to matching criteria
- matching criteria: go through queries, move to subfolders, rename, change table space, change filenames in report document (Nick)
- after matching criteria: data preparation (blacklist, pubyear, article type preprocessing + maybe article length column) (Anne)
- matching algorithm: decide whether to use with or without extra matched dois, maybe two versions (Anne)
- results(both):  - how many additionally matched
            - look into probably falsly matched records
            - precision / recall analysis (for second version?)
            
            - manual sample checks:
                - matched articles with wos null doi
