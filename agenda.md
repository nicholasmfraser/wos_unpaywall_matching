# Suggestions for ToDos / things to discuss
## Agenda

- explore results
- finish writing text:
  - description of results
  - discussion (limitations)
  - formulate recommendations (e.g. use blacklist, use issn as preselection)
- add references, bibliography
- clean up sql queries (maybe switch to using code chunks again instead of extra files?)

## Remarks and Questions

- Should we count distinct ut_eids/dois in [these queries](https://github.com/nicholasmfraser/wos_unpaywall_matching/blob/df770be065967c1b070cf3e16ff246cbb23753d4/report.Rmd#L223) and the following?
- Does it make sense to have a few documents for exploration and analysis and one mainly textual document as report, including some figures generated in the other files?
- blacklisting as preprocessing to reduce runtime of matching?
